# Fake-News-Detection-Project
Overview:
This project aimed to develop a robust fake news detection system using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques. The objective was to combat the proliferation of misinformation and fake news in online platforms by accurately classifying news articles as either real or fake.

Methodology:
Utilized a curated dataset sourced from Kaggle, containing news articles labeled as real or fake.
Implemented various NLP techniques including tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and vectorization for data preprocessing.
Employed machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to build and evaluate classification models.
Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the effectiveness of different classifiers.

Key Outcomes:
Achieved a highest accuracy of 99% using SVM, demonstrating strong performance in distinguishing between real and fake news articles.
Conducted a comparative analysis of different ML algorithms, highlighting SVM as the most effective classifier for fake news detection based on the dataset.
Emphasized the significance of employing NLP and ML techniques in combating the spread of fake news and misinformation online.
